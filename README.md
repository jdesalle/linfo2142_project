    - commit id : 62dbd8be1d3a3a040d1f3afc400bebfaa79658d7
    - You have to apply a patch to make it work (Big thanks to [Fran√ßois Michel](https://github.com/francoismichel))

### Methodology

Client characteristics :
* Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS
* Kernel: Linux 5.11.0-41-generic
* Architecture: x86-64

To compare the performance of TCP and QUIC, we decided to download files from our NGINX server using `curl` with the HTTP3 integration (quiche version).

**Examples** : 

Download using QUIC : 
```
curl --http3 -w "@curl-format.txt" -X GET -k  https://130.104.229.21/files/empty_file -o test
```

Download using TCP : 
```
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -X GET -k  https://130.104.229.21/files/empty_file -o test
```
